# Machine Learning Research 2023 - 2024
This is my contribution to Student Research from 1/2023 to 6/2024, which won first prize and was posted in the Journal of Science Natural Science - HNUE University.

This project aims to develop a system that automatically identifies 11 domains (such as learning, dormitory, tuition fee, ... and others) of comments associated with online media posts.

The whole project consists of 3 steps:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Word embedding
3. Training, evaluating, and fine-tuning model - Which I am responsible for.

To run the project on Jupiter notebook (UTC_training), simply modify the path to the dataset and model in the section "WORKSPACE".
To run the project on your local machine, you can directly execute the notebook.py script.
